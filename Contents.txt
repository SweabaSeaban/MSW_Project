***********************************Hallucinogens - Referral Advice**************************

YOU ARE AT HIGH RISK OF EXPERIENCING HEALTH, SOCIAL, FINANCIAL, LEGAL AND RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS BASED ON YOUR CURRENT HALLUCINOGEN USE.

You are at risk of experiencing sleeping difficulties, nausea, vomiting, increased blood pressure, mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia, flashbacks and increased effects of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.

The effects of any drug vary from person to person. The effect is the result of three interacting factors:

-The drug itself
-The individual user
-The environment in which drug use occurs

While the effect that a drug has on a person is determined by many factors, the primary factors that influence a drug’s effect are the type of drug and the quantity used. It is important to remember that any illicit drug use can put you at risk of health, social, financial and legal problems. These risks also apply to prescription medication when taken for reasons other than prescribed.

Illegal drugs are not subject to quality controls and the active ingredient is not consistent. You can never be sure what is actually in it and how it will affect you. Even ‘one off’ use can lead to serious harms. Federal and state laws provide penalties for possessing, using, producing, selling or driving under the influence of illicit drugs. Penalties can include fines, disqualification from driving, rehabilitation orders and imprisonment. Think about how any of these consequences could impact your life.

To avoid the risks and harms associated with drugs, the best option is to not use them. This can be difficult for some people who may have become dependent on them and feel symptoms of withdrawal if they stop or reduce their use.

Help is available. You may like to start by finding out more about hallucinogens and their effects click here./

You are also encouraged to talk to a health professional or local drug and alcohol service if you would like more information or support in quitting your use.
