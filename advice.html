                                The eASSIST is an electronic version of the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement
                                Screening Test (ASSIST) which was developed by the World Health Organization. The ASSIST
                                has eight questions and takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. The ASSIST helps
                                identify the risks associated with substance use and the personalised feedback helps
                                explore options for change.
